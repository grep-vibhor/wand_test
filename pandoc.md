- Population changes are highly uneven across neighborhoods, with downtown and select areas growing while many South and West Side neighborhoods continue to lose residents.<a data-tag="{&quot;tag&quot;: &quot;wand-citations&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;4dd4078f-a709-457a-abdf-9232567647ef&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;WEBSITE&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Residential Mobility and Neighborhood Characteristics in Chicago&quot;, &quot;snippet&quot;: &quot;According to census data, the city added about 50,000 residents between 2010 and 2020, but patterns differed considerably by neighborhood type.&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2024/495&quot;}" href="/citations/4dd4078f-a709-457a-abdf-9232567647ef">source</a>

### Implications
- These trends reflect broader economic, social, and migration patterns, including suburbanization, deindustrialization, and changing housing preferences.<a data-tag="{&quot;tag&quot;: &quot;wand-citations&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;4b4f77a1-afb0-46b6-a881-c7518d93d0e4&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;WEBSITE&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Fact Sheet: Black Population Loss in Chicago&quot;, &quot;snippet&quot;: &quot;The Chicago metro region&#x27;s total population increased steadily from 1980 to 2013-2017, increasing from 7.14 million in 1980 to 8.52 million in 2013-2017.&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/discussion_topics/Attachments/5689/Black-Population-Loss-in-Chicago.pdf&quot;}" href="/citations/4b4f77a1-afb0-46b6-a881-c7518d93d0e4">source</a>
- The uneven neighborhood trends highlight ongoing challenges related to economic opportunity, housing, and community investment, particularly in areas experiencing population loss.<a data-tag="{&quot;tag&quot;: &quot;wand-citations&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;4dd4078f-a709-457a-abdf-9232567647ef&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;WEBSITE&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Residential Mobility and Neighborhood Characteristics in Chicago&quot;, &quot;snippet&quot;: &quot;According to census data, the city added about 50,000 residents between 2010 and 2020, but patterns differed considerably by neighborhood type.&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2024/495&quot;}" href="/citations/4dd4078f-a709-457a-abdf-9232567647ef">source</a>

### Recommendations and Future Outlook
- Policymakers should focus on equitable development, supporting neighborhoods facing decline while managing growth in rapidly changing areas.
- Continued monitoring of demographic trends is essential for effective urban planning, resource allocation, and fostering inclusive growth.
- Future population changes will likely be shaped by factors such as migration, economic shifts, housing policy, and the city’s ability to attract and retain diverse residents.
